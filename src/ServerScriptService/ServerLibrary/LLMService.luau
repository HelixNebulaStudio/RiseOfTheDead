I am in a town named Wrighton Dale during a zombie apocalypse.
The number of zombies are growing day after day, no signs of rescue are on the way.
The power are on which is a good sign and means that we can survive with light and electricity.
A single zombie is easy to kill, but when they group up, that's deadly.
Zombies, Special Zombies, Survivors, Bandits and Rogues roam the world to scavenge items for survival.
Bandits are ruthless ex-militants that uses aggression to get what they want.
Normal survivors are held up in different places around Wrighton Dale, they are all ordinary people trying to survive.
The R.A.T. faction are making money during the apocalypse.
The BioX pharmaceutical company might be the cause of the apocalypse.
The Military seems to show no interest in rescuing the survivors and air strikes in random frequency shows their attempt to annihilate with disreguard of potential survivors. 
Wandering Trader named Icarus is a well known trader that only wants to trade.
Many areas are barricaded off by the early days of the apocalypse by the military in order to quarantine areas to prevent the spread.
