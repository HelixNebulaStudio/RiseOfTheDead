Currently, introducing new mods requires it designed to be viable because it is completing for a spot with damage mods. In order to be meta, it may be hard to trade damage mods for something unique. Hence designing mods unrelated to damage can be tricky. 

Damage mods are a necessity, often taking up at least 1-2 modding slots. What if we had +damage on every mod so instead of needing to dedicate slots to damage, you can have a more interesting build and still have damage.

All numbers are subject to change until balancing from play tests.
### Change
All modifiers will now provide now based on their tier. Mods tiers will be changed to fit the amount of damage they should provide.

For reference, Pistol Damage Mod currently provides 50% + (10% Tweak) additional premod damage.

A Pistol Fire Rate is a tier 1 mod. It will now provide 25% premod damage.
### Damage Mods
Since every mod will provide damage, default damage mods will be rebalanced to match the damage prior which would likely be a nerf.

### Under Appreciated Mods
Some mods has a unique purpose that may be fun but not worth trading damage for. The Pistol Magazine mod is only enjoyed by a few, giving it natural damage would make it more viable.
