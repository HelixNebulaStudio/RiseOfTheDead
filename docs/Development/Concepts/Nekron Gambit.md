A lot has been added to Nekron's Gambit since last introduction to the new game mode.

### Pawns

Added pawns which pushes the lane. They will fight enemy pawns with melee and range. Each pawn wave consist of 1 melee pawn, 2 range pawn and a medic pawn. Medic pawn heals all allies within radius.

### Sols

Currency and farming has been added. You earn **sols** by supporting your pawns kill enemy pawns. Enemy pawns dying in radius grants you sols, sol orbs that floats up can be shot for bonus sols. You can shoot both red and green sol orbs. Shooting allied sol orbs denies enemies from obtaining the bonus sol.

### Scoreboard

Added scoreboard, currently shows player total sols, kills, death, and assist. Scoreboard can be opened by pressing `Tab`, rebindable in settings under Nekron's Gambit category.

### Shop

Added WIP shop, open by pressing B. Shop contains all kinds of item modifiers. Weapon mods, Character mods, and Flex mods. 
Weapon mods will add modifiers that increases stats, add passives or even active abilities.
Character mods will add modifiers for character improvements in terms of health, armor, movement, utility.
Flex mods are modifiers that gives you unique abilities such as throwing grenades etc..

### Inventory

Inventory is also separated in 3 categories, Weapon(Red), Character(Green) and Flex(Blue).
Weapon slots can only store weapon mods. Character slots for character mods.
Flex slots can store any type of mods, so theoretically, you can have up to 8 weapon mods.

### Pvp / Coop Vs AI

This game mode is intended to be pvp, but I would hope to add a Coop Vs AI mode in order to learn the gamemode / not participate in the intense pvp. This hope will be quite hard to work out to introduce NPC that can take a player's place.

### King/Throne

Like any MOBA, there will be a throne to destroy in order to win. A King will take its place here as the final target.
