An concept to tie in player's safehomes into a location on the world map. By default, it'll look like the safehome belongs there but has no owner.

A player could interact with it in order to load in their customizations, npcs and others into the structure. 

This enables the possibility to for other players to see and explore each others safehome. 

Every player will share the same spot to load their safehome so if another player wants to see your safehome, they'll have to interact with a sign to change who's safehome they are viewing.
